Introduction
============

The `RT1` package implements a bistatic first order scattering radiative transfer model that might be used for generic purposes. Unique features of this model are

* analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation up to first order with flexible BRDF and volume phase function specifications.
* extensive nonlinear least-squares fit module for parameter estimation
* thoroughly tested model code
