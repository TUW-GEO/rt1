Introduction
============

The `RT1` package implements a bistatic first order scattering radiative transfer model that might be used for generic purposes. Unique features of this model are

* analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation with flexible BRDF and volume phase function specifications.
* representation of surface BRDF and volume phase functions through Legendre-polynomials
* thoroughly tested model code
