The standard python way
-----------------------

You can also download the source code package from the `project website <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/rt1/branches>`_ or from `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rt1>`_. Unpack the file you obtained into some directory (it can be a temporary directory) and then run::

    python setup.py install

If might be that you might need administrator rights for this step, as the program tries to install into system library pathes. To install into a user specific directory please refer to the `pip` documentation.
