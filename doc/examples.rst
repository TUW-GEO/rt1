Examples
--------

In the following, we provide reference to a couple of examples that reproduce the figures in the manuscript of `Quast & Wagner (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.55.005379>`_.

A script that produces all examples is provided in the doc/examples directory. The following links provide however links to ipython notebooks in the hope that this will facilitate the user to better understand the general concepts of the code.

* `Example 1 from Quast and Wagner (2016) <./examples/example1.ipynb>`_
* `Example 2 from Quast and Wagner (2016) <./examples/example2.ipynb>`_
* Example 3: useage of a linear combination for the phase function and BRDF
