Examples
--------

In the following, we provide reference to a couple of examples that reproduce the figures in the manuscript of `Quast & Wagner (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.55.005379>`_.

A script that produces all examples is provided in the doc/examples directory. The following links provide however links to IPython notebooks in the hope that this will facilitate the user to better understand the general concepts of the code.
