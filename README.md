# RT1 - bistatic scattering model for first order scattering of random media

The package implements a first order scattering radiative transfer model for random volume over ground as documented in Quast & Wagner (2016).

The documentation of the package is found [here](http://rt1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Note that the documentation is still under construction.
